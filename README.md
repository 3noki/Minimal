# Minimal

Minimal is a personal website and blog template. Both the Node.js and Go runtime are supported. Minimal does not have external dependencies and less than 500 lines of code. Everything is minimal, easy to take appart, rewrite or port.

## Getting Started

To get started, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository) this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/Minimal.git && cd Minimal
```

Modify `app.json` to your liking. The symbol codes for social links can be found [here](http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont). 

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed and run:

```bash
./admin start
```

This will start `node app.js` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

`./admin` is a [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) script that can be run from Git Bash or [WLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) on Windows.
